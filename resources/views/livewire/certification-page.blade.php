            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">What is ULC Certification?</h1>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Underwriters Laboratories of Canada (ULC) sets the highest standard for alarm monitoring companies for
                Commercial Burglary, Financial Burglary and Fire. ULC provides the guidelines for security installations
                that include: uninterrupted power supplies, response times, appropriate staffing levels and security
                levels.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why should you have it?</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Because it matters to Authorities Having Jurisdiction, insurance companies, thoroughly tested, and is
                maintained to the highest standards. Both of SecurTek’s monitoring stations are ULC listed and SecurTek
                is certified to perform ULC Commercial Burglary, ULC Financial Burglary and ULC Fire installations.

            <p class="mb-4">Other benefits:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>It may be required by law: in some jurisdictions the tenant is not allowed to occupy a new building
                    until the ULC Fire certificate has been issued.</li>
                <li>It may improve insurance benefits: CUMIS will insure 100% of losses in a credit union if the theft
                    occurred from a cash unit which has a level 2 or level 3 ULC certificate.</li>
                <li>It may reduce insurance costs: premiums may be lower, depending on the insurance provider.</li>
                <li>It increases customer/tenant/board/investor confidence: ULC certification indicates that the
                    installation is inspected, tested and maintained by the Listed alarm service company.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">ULC Commercial Burglary/Fire</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                ULC certificated alarm systems are required to be maintained under the care and inspection service of
                the issuing alarm service company. A ULC certificate indicates that the installation is inspected,
                tested and maintained - which assists insurance companies and regulatory authorities in deciding their
                manpower involvement in conducting their own monitoring and acceptance of companies.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">ULC Financial Burglary</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
